# Hackathon project: Organized by Shannex

# Challenge Statement:
Frail, older adults living in LTC are at increased risk of falling, resulting in adverse consequences such as hospitalization, hip fracture, and even death. Several fall prevention strategies have been adopted in LTC to reduce falling among residents and fall rate is a key performance indicator (KPI) for LTC providers. How can the data sources provided expand our understanding of falling among LTC residents and how can it be used to improve prevention through predictive modeling?

# Our Solution:
To address our challenge we studied the correlation between different factors and fall rate using the provided data set and used predictive modelling to help mitigate the risks of falling in older adults.

# What I did?
Used statistical correlation between different factors and fall rate in old adults living in Long Term Care (LTC) and also used linear regression for predictive modelling.


# Notes
Our team was awarded 3rd prize for our work on the challenge statement.
